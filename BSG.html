		<h4><u>At Baked Steak Games</u></h4>	
			<p>We want Among The Hunted to be as strikingly human as possible. This means that this game won't be another shoot 'em up style game;<br>
			we want to encourage the fact that the hunters are stronger, faster, and better equipped than you. You will have to carefully plan<br> how to combat the hunters because they will kill you
			much easier than you can kill them.</p>
